    <p>
        California Code of Regulations, Title 3, Division 8, Chapter 1 requires

        it can be viewed by state or local agencies.

    <p>
        <b>California Cannabis Track-and-Trace (CCTT) System Access:</b>
        If the Designated Responsible Party for this license has not already registered
        for and participated in the required CCTT system training, the Designated
        Responsible Party must register and attend this required training prior
        to being credentialed as the Licensee’s initial track-and-trace account
        manager.
        <u>
            Access to the CCTT system will not be granted until this training is completed.
        </u>
        To register for CCTT system training, please access the following URL:

    <p>
        If the Designated Responsible Party for the license has already registered
        and participated in the required training, please contact the Franwell
        support desk at telephone number

        to establish an initial login to the CCTT system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Designated Responsible Party will be required to agree to system usage
        terms and conditions, and provide an attestation upon initial CCTT system
        log-in. If the Designated Responsible Party intends to delegate primary
        responsibility for updating and maintaining the Licensee’s cannabis distribution
        chain information in the CCTT system to another owner or employee in the
        Licensee’s organization, the Designated Responsible Party will also need
        to establish that individual as the track-and-trace account manager within
        the CCTT system. The track-and-trace account manager is responsible for
        establishing and maintaining logins and permissions for any other Licensee
        employees that require access to the CCTT system and providing those users
        training in how to use the CCTT system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within 30 business days of receipt of required unique identifiers (UIDs)
        ordered by the Licensee, the Licensee is responsible for following the
        requirements found in California Code of Regulations, title 3, section
        8407, if applicable.
